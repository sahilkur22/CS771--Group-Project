## Assignments
In each assignment, we were given a problem statement after being taught some methods/models:

+ [<u>Assignment 1:</u>](./assn1/) Exercise on using [SVMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine). We explored SGDM to solve it, but ended up submitting SCDM with a bunch of case-specific optimizations.
+ [<u>Assignment 2:</u>](./assn2/) The problem was that of multilabel classification, with complete freedom to use whatever one wants. Our group ended up using a mix of [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree), and [Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).
