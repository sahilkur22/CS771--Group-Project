## Assignments
In each assignment, we were given a problem statement after being taught some methods/models:

+ [<u>Assignment 1:</u>](https://github.com/sahilkur22/CS771--Group-Project/tree/main/ASSIGNMENT-2) This assignment demonstrates that linear models can perfectly predict the responses of a Cross-Connection PUF (COCO-PUF) and can be accurately estimated with enough challenge-response pairs.
+ [<u>Assignment 2:</u>](https://github.com/sahilkur22/CS771--Group-Project/tree/main/ASSIGNMENT-2) This assignment involves developing an ML algorithm to predict a sequence of words given a list of bigrams. We chose a decision tree classifier for its simplicity and interpretability.
